# qmf-docker

Dockerfile for Quora's [QMF](https://github.com/quora/qmf) library.

Installs dependencies, builds source, and runs tests.

I'm sure it can be optimized, but it works!

Before building the image you need to clone the qmf repo into this directory with command

`git clone https://github.com/quora/qmf.git`
